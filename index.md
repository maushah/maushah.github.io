### Musings

- Self filling S3 bucket issues and how to resolve https://github.com/maushah/maushah.github.io/blob/master/s3-logs

- Neat explanation of K8S roles, rolebindings and how they get mapped to AWS IAM on an EKS cluster - would be nice if AWS made this less complicated https://www.agilepartner.net/en/adding-users-to-your-eks-cluster/

- Cost optimization and the tools https://harness.io/blog/kubecost-alternatives/
